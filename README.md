## 🛰️ Purpose & Vision

NaijaNexus AI acts as a **smart observatory and simulation tool** that aggregates, visualizes, and simulates real-time data streams across:

- ⚡ National power grid & outages  
- 👥 Population and urban expansion  
- 🌦️ Climate impact and weather shifts  
- 📡 Telecommunications coverage  
- 🚗 Mobility and transport infrastructure

Its mission is to empower government agencies with **interactive dashboards, AI insights, and geospatial visualizations** for critical decision-making.
